			The DiMenna-Nyselius Library uses the ILLiad Resource Sharing Management Software to provide patrons with the most streamlined and efficient process for interlibrary loan and document delivery.  Students, staff and faculty can manage their own accounts - requesting, receiving, and viewing the status of their book, article, and audio-visual requests.  Faculty and staff can take advantage of the library’s Document Delivery service, requesting book chapters and journal articles from the library’s own collection using the same form as interlibrary loan.   In keeping with the university’s green initiatives, making these web-based tools available to patrons saves time and eliminates excess paperwork.  Any questions regarding this service can be directed to the Interlibrary Services Department at:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ils@fairfield.edu?Subject=ILS%20Illiad%20Question">ils@fairfield.edu</a>
